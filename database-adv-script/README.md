# SQL Joins - Mastering Complex Queries

## Objective:
This project is aimed at mastering SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins. The following joins are explored:

1. **INNER JOIN**
2. **LEFT JOIN**
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN**

# correlated and non-correlated subqueries
## Objective

1. Query to find all properties where the average rating is greater than 4.0 using a subquery.

2. Correlated subquery to find users who have made more than 3 bookings.

# SQL aggregation and window functions to analyze data.
## Objective
1.Query to find the total number of bookings made by each user, using the COUNT function and GROUP BY clause.

2. Window function (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) to rank properties based on the total number of bookings they have received.
